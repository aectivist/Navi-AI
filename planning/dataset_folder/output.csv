/wav/Futaba-Sakura/1.wav| 트기 트기 트기 트기 트기!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/2.wav| Ooh, wow! You sure we can drive here?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/3.wav| This course looks like it would be fun to race on.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/4.wav| Mmm, so dark. I could get used to this. It's relaxing.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/5.wav| I'm fine in this darkness. I've got all my sensors.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/6.wav| This darkness...it's so...undergroundy!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/7.wav| Mmm, that noise bugs me.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/8.wav| I can hear people's voices in the wind.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/9.wav|альの判渡姿勢 I'll give it a goW er$$&%&%&%&%."GonD Descendants
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/10.wav| How are my navigation skills? Pretty useful, right?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/11.wav| I wanna see more shadows. Where are they?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/12.wav| Maybe I can rate your fighting skills with some kind of power level.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/13.wav| What exactly are shadows I wonder?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/14.wav| Shadows are weird. Summer but ugly, but summer cute.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/15.wav| It's way different seeing the real thing compared to pics!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/16.wav| Ha ha ha ha ha ha, the scene is so poppy.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/17.wav| It's cramped in here, but that's what makes it good.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/18.wav| I want to make this interior more functional.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/19.wav| Heh heh heh. All the girl's thief suits are so kinky.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/20.wav| My thesis is cool too! It's so fun to look at!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/21.wav| Heh heh heh! Even expert cosplayers can't make a suit this good!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/22.wav| I'm tired. Need sugar. Candy.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/23.wav| If you eat chocolate and gum at the same time, they both disappear.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/24.wav| Aww, I want some of Sojiro's food. His curry is the best.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/25.wav| Buh, I need something strong to drink. My mind's all fuzzy.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/26.wav| So bumpy! Whoops! There goes Masoda!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/27.wav| Oh, I could use some of Sojiro's coffee.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/28.wav| So the other day, I was checking out this foreign military-based server and-
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/29.wav| on the PC outside. This is totally outdoor activity.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/30.wav| Right now, I'm totally into overclocking.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/31.wav| collective unconscious. So it's kind of like the internet.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/32.wav| Oh, this reminds me. The other day on the internet, there was... ...Hahahaha!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/33.wav| Ooh, Phantom Thieves is trending!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/34.wav| Why do you go shopping? You can buy anything online.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/35.wav| I want a new PC. I guess I'll settle for some new parts.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/36.wav| Shopping, huh? I'm still scared to talk to the salespeople.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/37.wav| Everyone's going to school, huh? Ha! Miss Dalger.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/38.wav| School, huh? I wish I could just use my PC there.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/39.wav| I don't need school. I can just look things up online.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/40.wav| Yeah, go go! From Rome!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/41.wav| Yeah! Faster! Faster!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/42.wav| Muna, this is awesome! Now transform into flight mode!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/43.wav| That floppy part of Joker's coat is so cool.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/44.wav| One day, I want to look good and close like Panthers.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/45.wav| I wish I could turn into a car like Mona does.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/46.wav| Wow, Skull, you're a terrible singer, but it's kind of fun.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/47.wav| Why? Dark is nice and relaxing.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/48.wav| Oh, awesome! I'm so excited!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/49.wav| It's like, guwaa! Like a big hair dryer.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/50.wav| Skull gets knocked out a lot too, huh?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/51.wav| Refreshing! More refreshing than soda?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/52.wav| Humans are kind of scarier in some ways.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/53.wav| Radio's are nice. I like the late night shows.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/54.wav| Ooh, and a massage chair! Get on it, Mona!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/55.wav| All my footage of it looks super weird. Even featherman would think we're freaks.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/56.wav| I use a cooling pad on the back of my neck. You ought to try it.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/57.wav| Oh yeah, that crutch!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/58.wav| I always want something sweet after something salty.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/59.wav| Are there any vending machines around? It is the subway.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/60.wav| Joker can do a bunch too. Who's stronger?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/61.wav| Ooh, showing off. Do you have a six-pack skull?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/62.wav| All budget local commercials are the best, right?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/63.wav| Yeah, I won't want to shoot paintballs!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/64.wav| I'm impressed you're even going to school. No can do.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/65.wav| Sounds cool. Yeah, let's blast through.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/66.wav| Does Mona even have an accelerator?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/67.wav| Then let's squat instead. Ready? Go!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/68.wav| Is it hurt? You okay Mona?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/69.wav| Yeah, it's tough being stuck on the tracks of life. Ana, you're so deep!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/70.wav| You're trying to act so cool. Look out or you'll get tickled.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/71.wav| Sounds the same as any other place full of people.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/72.wav| What are they saying? Maybe let's get some pizza.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/73.wav| Fighting's fun!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/74.wav| Yeah, I'll back you up with all my skills.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/75.wav| We need to be efficient in here. You need my help, Joker?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/76.wav| Don't worry about it. Oops, drop some candy.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/77.wav| But naked except for a scarf, Mona's got guts.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/78.wav| I like aerodynamic styles too. We should stick some mods on you.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/79.wav| I like the Spinny Sushi too. I feel like Flon, and Mellon.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/80.wav| There's new ones all the time too! I want to finish my collection.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/81.wav| If you had a fuel door, we could just dump a drink in there.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/82.wav| I wanna use my eye drops, but I can't when it's shaking so much!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/83.wav| Sometimes you can find out what they're really thinking online.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/84.wav| I can't even tell what you're going for. What kind of mascot are you?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/85.wav| Leave the internet to me! You guys can handle everything else.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/86.wav| Hehe, that's what makes it fun.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/87.wav| I don't like walking in a crowd. Shopping online is more fun.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/88.wav| But aren't small spaces kinda nice? I like them.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/89.wav| Yeah, being a thief is all about making cold hard cash!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/90.wav| I'll be your guide, Mona. Let's do our best.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/91.wav| Whoa, Panther! They're huge! I don't know where to look when they shake!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/92.wav| Only one thing to do, drive on in!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/93.wav| Thanks Mona, walking is really tiring.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/94.wav| Probably, considering where we are, a lot of them too.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/95.wav| Sound bounces off everything in here. It's tough to search using audio signals.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/96.wav| You gotta have the right pose. Everyone have theirs down?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/97.wav| You'd feel sorry for them if they were cute. It's better that they're all monster-y!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/98.wav| No holds barred, weapons, personas, cheap shots, anything goes!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/99.wav| If you have a racing controller, you can just practice at home.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/100.wav| But you look like you're having the most fun in battle, Panther.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/101.wav| And tails are so cool, I don't want to if I could.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/102.wav| Sweet, huh? So you're a dessert girl!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/103.wav| You gotta check out the new stuff, right? Joker does it too!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/104.wav| HOT CHOCOLATE! GIMME CHOCOLATE!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/105.wav| Games are better than studying. Huh, could you make studying a game?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/106.wav| Can't wait for Thursday, right? Another one in the backlog.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/107.wav| Exploring is basically a game already. We gotta clear this floor.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/108.wav| Some DVRs can record all channels at once. Not that you'd have time to watch everything.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/109.wav| Shopping day with Panther, huh? Ooh, a social event.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/110.wav| They say the walls have eyes, and as long as they watch you, you'll never boil. Wait.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/111.wav| I don't like weird teachers. Well, actually, I just don't like teachers.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/112.wav| You're really into it, Panther. You're bouncing all over the place!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/113.wav| Hehe, I wonder what Mona's max speed is.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/114.wav| Is there a secret button somewhere? Poop, poke!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/115.wav| I never have enough time. There's so much stuff I wanna do.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/116.wav| Oh, I see! You're a Trangie Kainari!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/117.wav| Wow, your face is super pale. Oh wait, that's normal.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/118.wav| Should I save a picture then? I'll print it out later.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/119.wav| Don't worry, Fox. I'm scouting.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/120.wav| Whoa! That sounds awesome!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/121.wav| I know.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/122.wav| Exactly! You gotta think when you fight. War is a mind game.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/123.wav| It'd be hard to replicate them, even with CG.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/124.wav| Yeah, I get like them after an all-nighter.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/125.wav| Comfort is important. The seat in my room is optimized for relaxing.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/126.wav| Oh, yeah, let's make it one of those cars with the anime stuff all over it.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/127.wav| Sounds like a plan. Want to make real world versions of them later?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/128.wav| Then your new code name can be, Tonneke.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/129.wav| That sucks. So what you're always makes dinner for me.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/130.wav| See, Fox gets it. Dr. Selt is a drink for the brain.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/131.wav| A marathon? I can't believe that's a hobby for some people.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/132.wav| Ugh! Nobody's draining my blood!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/133.wav| Oh, you interested? I could give you a crash course.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/134.wav| Hold on, let me look it up for you.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/135.wav| You know, there's this thing called online shopping.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/136.wav| Loaners are cool, man. Screw the social types.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/137.wav| Oh, they're kind of like their reviews on shopping sites, right?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/138.wav| Yeah, yeah, do it!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/139.wav| Let's katana maintenance. Do you just sharpen it? Doesn't that sound get on your nerves?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/140.wav| Yikes, cars are totally your weakness. Hang in there.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/141.wav| This meta versus full of mysteries. It's pretty fun.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/142.wav| Ooh, that sounds like fun! I'll keep a lookout!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/143.wav| I think it's nice. I'm good as long as I have the light in my monitor.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/144.wav| whose voice is it? I could record it and analyze it.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/145.wav| Maybe if we use a voice translator, we could figure out what they're saying.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/146.wav| Yeah, out of all of us, Queen's the most extreme in a fight.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/147.wav| Maybe they eat humans. Oh geez, I just freaked myself out.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/148.wav| It talks, it rides. Mona's pretty awesome.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/149.wav| I wonder how much longer till we have full on self-driving cars?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/150.wav| Really? I like mine!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/151.wav| Ha ha, you look good in it.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/152.wav| I get perfect dietary balance from supplements and nutrition bars.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/153.wav| Sweet then salty, that's a dangerous loop.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/154.wav| Roger that! You're kinda like Sojiro Queen.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/155.wav| Yeah, he's kinda like Soji Ronal. Hey Joker, what was that face for?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/156.wav| You're amazing, Queen. I don't even like walking.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/157.wav| No, don't! They might already have everything exactly where they wanted!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/158.wav| If anything happens, I'll look it up. Don't worry about him.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/159.wav| Ooh, have you read all the niche stuff? I'll make a recommendation list.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/160.wav| I have a couple I follow too. They're all online, of course.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/161.wav| They come from America, right? Gotta import the good stuff.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/162.wav| I wonder which of us stands out the most.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/163.wav| That's what I've been saying!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/164.wav| Queen really transforms sometimes. I like it.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/165.wav| Yeah, I wanna find out what's there.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/166.wav| Yeah, I don't know what to do when I play all those open world and sandbox games.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/167.wav| stiff shoulders, huh? Panther looks like she'd get them a lot too.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/168.wav| I read the subway's been around for 80 years or so. It's older than us.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/169.wav| The face is easy. You just put your right hand on the wall and go forward without lifting it.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/170.wav| Secret train stations are a big deal in real life too.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/171.wav| Oh, and his eyes are useful. I wonder if I could get mine to glow.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/172.wav| I'm searching, so don't worry. You can lighten up a little.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/173.wav| Concert, huh? I'd go to a show, but all those people...
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/174.wav| A shadow song! Wish I could look up the lyrics!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/175.wav| My room gets like that too if I don't open the window for a while.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/176.wav| She's got that whole two-faced thing going on.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/177.wav| Oh, what was that called? Sadies, saddest?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/178.wav| She just can't stop. Now where is a real battle nut?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/179.wav| Character, what does that even mean? I'm gonna look it up
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/180.wav| A shadow picture, huh? We'll bring my tablet next time and try it.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/181.wav| I never liked field trips, but I loved Sojiro's bento boxes.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/182.wav| Let's make it even cooler! Custom Paint job mods!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/183.wav| I'd like it even more if it were a teensy bit smaller.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/184.wav| We look like a pile of freaks.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/185.wav| Fuck's this mask just makes me wanna doodle on it.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/186.wav| You look good in a war, you'd be perfect for cosplaying.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/187.wav| Uuuh, just thinking about it is making me full.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/188.wav| Mushrooms might work. And then Fox could eat them.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/189.wav| Sogeros says I'm only supposed to have one a week.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/190.wav| Ooh, a smoothie. That's a real celebrity drink.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/191.wav| I want some of Sojiro's coffee.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/192.wav| It's from Joker and Mona, and maybe a little from me too.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/193.wav| I could probably find an automatic flower water online.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/194.wav| Cherry tomatoes, grow them and eat them.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/195.wav| I read that plants can hear music. Nature's incredible.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/196.wav| I read a couple of them. I sucked.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/197.wav| I stay up online and then all of a sudden, it's light outside.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/198.wav| Oh, that's crazy, Newar! Can I hang on your arm next time?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/199.wav| I can check online. Want me to download some catalogs?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/200.wav| Wait, what? You don't put it on a card?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/201.wav| School, huh? I just wish there weren't classes or people.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/202.wav| Looking at turtles makes me want to sit under a kotatsu.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/203.wav| It's the same as the internet then. The Phantom Theives will take over conversations everywhere.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/204.wav| Roger, let's do it!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/205.wav| Taxi to the ends of the world and step on it!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/206.wav| Ah, you sound like a total beauty thief!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/207.wav| I wanna drive too. I wonder if he'll let me.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/208.wav| I know what you mean. I want to ride on the tracks in real life.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/209.wav| Yeah, yeah, we're all really tough.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/210.wav| Maybe the hidden meaning is that it means nothing.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/211.wav| Because it's the subway! Dun dun dun!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/212.wav| Hey, no scary talk. Queen doesn't like it.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/213.wav| We are professional and don't compliment me so much. It's kind of embarrassing.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/214.wav| Yep, he thinks several moves ahead. I won't lose though.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/215.wav| Hey, they let their guard down. If we don't run him over, they'll attack us.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/216.wav| But the shakiness is the best part! You gotta learn what's good, Crow.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/217.wav| Yeah, but I'm the coolest, right?
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/218.wav| I wanna try Panther suit. It's red. Plus it has a tail.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/219.wav| Scruti, coffee's the real deal. So D-Rose is the BEST!
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/220.wav| Worker ants work hard. They stay way busier than I do.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/221.wav| Yeah, well, internet discussions can be manipulated.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/222.wav| Join the club.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/223.wav| Ready for action, huh? I can handle offensive support.
/wav/Futaba-Sakura/224.wav| Make sure you pull your weight.
